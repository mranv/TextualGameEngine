# Textual Game Engine

## Overview

A simple textual game engine using C++ and the Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Build the project using a C++ compiler.
4. Run the executable.

## How to Build and Run

```
git clone https://github.com/mranv/TextualGameEngine.git && cd TextualGameEngine
```

## Compile the Project:

```
g++ -std=c++11 src/*.cpp src/systems/*.cpp src/components/*.cpp -o TextualGameEngine
```

## Run the Game:

```
    ./TextualGameEngine
```

This setup provides a foundational framework for a textual game engine using C++ and the ECS architecture. You can expand this by adding more components, systems, and enhancing the game logic to meet the specific requirements of your assignment.
